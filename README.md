# etch-a-sketch

## Introduction
As part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), I created this Etch-a-Sketch game using JavaScript and HTML

## Skills
This is one of the later projects of the foundations course, designed to bring together skills in JS, CSS, and HTML. My DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic design skills were strengthened, separating behaviour using dispatcher functions and dynamically switching drawing modes.

## Conclusion
A fun project, with some more refinement needed in naming functions and variables, as well as a cleaned-up GUI.
